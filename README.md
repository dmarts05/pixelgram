Pixelgram is a web application that allows users to create, publish and share Pixel Arts with a size of 128x128 pixels, as well as interact with other creations through comments and ‚Äúlikes‚Äù, all in a visual environment similar to that of social networks such as Instagram.
It includes features such as an interactive canvas, automatic generation of descriptions using AI, and the ability to import images to convert them into Pixel Art.

## ‚ú® Features

- üé® **Interactive Canvas**: A user-friendly interface for creating Pixel Art.
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Import**: Convert images into Pixel Art.
- ü§ñ **AI Description Generation**: Automatically generate descriptions for your Pixel Art.
- üí¨ **Social Interaction**: Like, comment and save any creations.
- üë§ **User Profiles**: Create and manage your own profile.
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- üîê **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system. Google OAuth 2.0 support.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Environment

This project supports development with Dev Containers in order to maintain a consistent setup across environments.

### Prerequisites

- Docker (for devcontainer)

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Set the .env file**:

   - Create a `.env` file in `backend/` folder.
   - Set the following variables:

     ```ini
     DB_URI=
     SECRET=
     GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=
     GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=
     FRONTEND_BASE_URL=
     HF_TOKEN=
     HF_IMG2TXT_MODEL=
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=
     SUPABASE_URL=
     SUPABASE_BUCKET=
     MAX_IMG_MB_SIZE=
     ```

     For `DB_URI`, you can use the DB container:

     ```ini
     DB_URI="postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres"
     ```

     For `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`, use this URL in development:

     ```ini
     FRONTEND_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5173"
     ```

     For `HF_IMG2TXT_MODEL`, you can use some free models from Hugging Face:

     ```ini
     HF_IMG2TXT_MODEL="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct"
     ```

> [!TIP]
> Visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) to learn to create a token for `HF_TOKEN`.

> [!TIP]
> Visit [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) to learn how to use Google OAuth 2.0 and set `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmarts05/pixelgram.git
   cd pixelgram
   ```
3. **Open in Dev Container (recommended)**:

   Pixelgram uses **two separate Dev Containers** for development: one for the `frontend` and one for the `backend`. Each folder contains its own `.devcontainer` configuration.

   To work with them:

   #### üîß Open the Frontend Dev Container

   1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
   2. Navigate to the `frontend/` folder.
   3. If you have the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed, Visual Studio Code will prompt you to reopen in a container.
   4. Or, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run:
      ```VS Code
      Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
      ```
   5. Wait for the container to build and start. This may take a few minutes, especially the first time.
   6. Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      bun install
      ```
   7. Start the development server:
      ```bash
       bun dev
      ```
   8. Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) to view the frontend app.

   #### üîß Open the Backend Dev Container

   1. Open a **new Visual Studio Code window**.

   2. Navigate to the `backend/` folder.

   3. Reopen this folder in a Dev Container using the same steps as above.

   4. Install dependencies:

      ```bash
      uv sync
      ```

   5. Start the development server:

      - Click the debug button in Visual Studio Code and select `Python Debugger: FastAPI`.
      - Or type in terminal:

        ```bash
        uvicorn pixelgram.__main__:app --reload
        ```

   6. Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs) to view the backend API.

> [!TIP]
> üß† Keep both Visual Studio Code windows open ‚Äî one for the frontend and one for the backend ‚Äî to work on both services simultaneously.

> [!NOTE]
> üê≥ Make sure Docker is running and both containers can run in parallel on your system.

## Testing the project

Pixelgram project contains unit tests for the backend, to guarantee that functionality implemented works properly.

The tests were made using pytest library for Python.

All the test files are located in the "tests" folder, inside the backend

### Running the tests

To run the tests, you need to open the backend dev container. Then, there are two ways to test the backend:

- Using the Testing section in Visual Studio Code. You must have the Python extension installed.
- Running the following command:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

## CI/CD and Deployment

To integrate new features correctly into the project and to ensure stability and quality, we used GitHub Actions. There are separate CI pipelines for both frontend and backend.

The backend pipeline will run the following actions:

- Clone repository and configure Python 3.13
- Install uv tool and sync the defined dependencies
- Run style and linting checks with Ruff
- Run the unit tests mentioned in the previous sections

The frontend pipeline will run the following actions:

- Clone repository and configure Bun as a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- Install Bun dependencies
- Build the project for production
- Check that code maintains Prettier format and pass linting with ESLint
